32858," REGISTER FOR FIRE WARDEN TRAINING AT https://houstontx.gov/fire/HFMO/highrisecert.html  Any Building Manager in need of High-Rise or Mid-Rise Atruim Certification Training may send attendees to the following monthly seminars at no cost. Monthly seminars are available for management employees and tenant fire wardens of high-rise buildings who need to be certified. Certificates shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of training. There is no charge for attending these seminars. The only cost incurred may be parking fees, if applicable. Many buildings will have different fire safety features. The building management from each building represented is required to inform its employees and Fire Wardens of their specific fire safety features to complete the certification. Please note this training is not valid for Mid Rise Evacuation Training. For information on mid rise training please visit the HFD Mid Rise Fire Certification Webpage. Additional training availability information: The Houston Fire Department has set up and implemented a list of all high- rise buildings for Fire Safety Plan approvals. This list was set up to ensure that priority is given to buildings that have the greatest need while also providing each building an equal opportunity. The list of buildings is separated into two groups based on whether the building is an occupancy where people sleep, such as hotel, apartments, and condominiums or those buildings where people do not sleep, such as office buildings. Buildings are then sub- grouped by no sprinkler system, partial sprinkler system, or complete sprinkler systems before sorting by building height. The highest priority building is the residential building that is non-sprinklered, and the tallest in height. Our goal is to provide the needed services to approve each building within a two-year cycle. Buildings desiring to expedite the process also have three additional options. The monthly open high-rise certification seminar is for buildings that have requested to send a limited number of fire wardens and building management employees to a class that is open to all high-rise buildings. The class information is not specific to any particular building and requires building management to supplement the training with their building specifics. An inspector/instructor in the Life Safety Bureau, Public Education Section - High-rise Fire Safety Plan Approvals, may be obtained to provide training outside his regular work hours on an overtime basis.

Monthly seminars are available for management employees and tenant fire wardens of high-rise buildings who need to be certified. Certificates shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of training. There is no charge for attending these seminars. The only cost incurred may be parking fees, if applicable. Many buildings will have different fire safety features. The building management from each building represented is required to inform its employees and Fire Wardens of their specific fire safety features to complete the certification. Please note this training is not valid for Mid Rise Evacuation Training. For information on mid rise training please visit the HFD Mid Rise Fire Certication Webpage. Additional training availability information: The Houston Fire Department has set up and implemented a list of all high- rise buildings for Fire Safety Plan approvals. This list was set up to ensure that priority is given to buildings that have the greatest need while also providing each building an equal opportunity. The list of buildings is separated into two groups based on whether the building is an occupancy where people sleep, such as hotel, apartments, and condominiums or those buildings where people do not sleep, such as office buildings. Buildings are then sub- grouped by no sprinkler system, partial sprinkler system, or complete sprinkler systems before sorting by building height. The highest priority building is the residential building that is non-sprinklered, and the tallest in height. Our goal is to provide the needed services to approve each building within a two-year cycle. Buildings desiring to expedite the process also have three additional options. 1.    The monthly open high-rise certification seminar is for buildings that have requested to send a limited number of fire wardens and building management employees to a class that is open to all high-rise buildings. The class information is not specific to any particular building and requires building management to supplement the training with their building specifics. 2.    An inspector/instructor in the Life Safety Bureau, Public Education Section - High-rise Fire Safety Plan Approvals, may be obtained to provide training outside his regular work hours on an overtime basis. This may be done by contacting Diana Cardenas by e-mail at: diana.cardenas@houstontx.gov. This should be done prior to payment of a required permit fee so that an instructor can be assigned to made contact with the requesting party, to assist the requesting party with information on the application for over-time training and payment of the permit fees, and to schedule a mutually convenient training date. A City of Houston permit fee is required to schedule an inspector/instructor. The permit fee is $326.89 plus an admin fee of $29.18 (as of January 2019). 3.    Having a City of Houston Fire Marshal approved consultant perform the training. The process to receive an approved Fire Safety Plan consist of the three following essential training elements conducted by persons, institutions or companies approved by the Fire Marshal according to regulations established by the Fire Marshal: a consultation with building management, an approved certification training for Fire Wardens and building employees, and a fire drill supervised by persons, institutions or companies approved by the Fire Marshal.",HighRise,LISA KIMBALL

These qualifications shall not be required where demonstration of adequate skills and experience satisfactory to the fire code official is provided. 510.5.3 Acceptance test procedure. When an emergency responder radio coverage system is required, and upon completion of installation, the building owner shall have the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 90 percent. The test procedure shall be conducted as follows: 1.    Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of 20 approximately equal test areas. 2.    The test shall be conducted using a calibrated portable radio of the latest brand and model used by the agency talking through the agency's radio communications system. 3.    Failure of a maximum of two nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. 4.    In the event that three of the test areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor shall be permitted to be divided into 40 equal test areas. Failure of a maximum of four nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. If the system fails the 40-area test, the system shall be altered to meet the 90 percent coverage requirement. 5.    A test location approximately in the center of each test area shall be selected for the test, with the radio enabled to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the public agency's radio communications system. Once the test location has been selected, that location shall represent the entire test area. Failure in the selected test location shall be considered failure of that test area. Additional test locations shall not be permitted. 6.    The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 7.

Testing shall consist of the following: 1.    In-building coverage test as described in Section 510.5.4. 2.    Signal boosters shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. 3.    Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the 1-hour test period the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional 1-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined. 4.    All other active components shall be checked to verify operation within the manufacturer's specifications. 5.    At the conclusion of the testing, a report, which shall verify compliance with Section 510.5.4, shall be submitted to the fire code official. 510.6.2 Additional frequencies.

Certification of in-building system training issued by a nationally recognized organization, school or a certificate issued by the manufacturer of the equipment being installed. These qualifications shall not be required where demonstration of adequate skills and experience satisfactory to the fire code official is provided. 510.5.3 Acceptance test procedure. When an emergency responder radio coverage system is required, and upon completion of installation, the building owner shall have the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each floor of the building is a minimum of 90 percent. The test procedure shall be conducted as follows: 1.    Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of 20 approximately equal test areas. 2.    The test shall be conducted using a calibrated portable radio of the latest brand and model used by the agency talking through the agency's radio communications system. 3.    Failure of a maximum of two nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. 4.    In the event that three of the test areas fail the test, in order to be more statistically accurate, the floor shall be permitted to be divided into 40 equal test areas. Failure of a maximum of four nonadjacent test areas shall not result in failure of the test. If the system fails the 40-area test, the system shall be altered to meet the 90 percent coverage requirement. 5.    A test location approximately in the center of each test area shall be selected for the test, with the radio enabled to verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the building through the public agency's radio communications system. Once the test location has been selected, that location shall represent the entire test area. Failure in the selected test location shall be considered failure of that test area. Additional test locations shall not be permitted. 6.    The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 7.    As part of the installation a spectrum analyzer or other suitable test equipment shall be utilized to ensure spurious oscillations are not being generated by the subject signal booster. This test shall be conducted at time of installation and subsequent annual inspections. 510.5.4 FCC compliance.

The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be inspected and tested annually or whenever structural changes occur including additions or remodels that could materially change the original field performance tests. Testing shall consist of the following: 1.    In-building coverage test as described in Section 510.5.4. 2.    Signal boosters shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. 3.    Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the 1-hour test period the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional 1-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined. 4.    All other active components shall be checked to verify operation within the manufacturer's specifications. 5.    At the conclusion of the testing, a report, which shall verify compliance with Section 510.5.4, shall be submitted to the fire code official. 510.6.2 Additional frequencies. The building owner shall modify or expand the emergency responder radio coverage system at their expense in the event frequency changes are required by the FCC or additional frequencies are made available by the FCC.

Monthly seminars are available for management employees and tenant fire wardens of high-rise buildings who need to be certified. Certificates shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of training. There is no charge for attending these seminars. The only cost incurred may be parking fees, if applicable. Many buildings will have different fire safety features. The building management from each building represented is required to inform its employees and Fire Wardens of their specific fire safety features to complete the certification. Please note this training is not valid for Mid Rise Evacuation Training. For information on mid-rise training please visit the HFD Mid Rise Fire Certification Webpage. Additional training availability information: The Houston Fire Department has set up and implemented a list of all high- rise buildings for Fire Safety Plan approvals. This list was set up to ensure that priority is given to buildings that have the greatest need while also providing each building an equal opportunity. The list of buildings is separated into two groups based on whether the building is an occupancy where people sleep, such as hotel, apartments, and condominiums or those buildings where people do not sleep, such as office buildings. Buildings are then sub- grouped by no sprinkler system, partial sprinkler system, or complete sprinkler systems before sorting by building height. The highest priority building is the residential building that is non-sprinklered, and the tallest in height. Our goal is to provide the needed services to approve each building within a two-year cycle. Buildings desiring to expedite the process also have three additional options. The monthly open high-rise certification seminar is for buildings that have requested to send a limited number of fire wardens and building management employees to a class that is open to all high-rise buildings. The class information is not specific to any particular building and requires building management to supplement the training with their building specifics. An inspector/instructor in the Life Safety Bureau, Public Education Section - High-rise Fire Safety Plan Approvals, may be obtained to provide training outside his regular work hours on an overtime basis. This may be done by contacting Diana Cardenas by e-mail at: diana.cardenas@houstontx.gov. This should be done prior to payment of a required permit fee so that an instructor can be assigned to made contact with the requesting party, to assist the requesting party with information on the application for over-time training and payment of the permit fees, and to schedule a mutually convenient training date.

64540," REGISTER FOR FIRE WARDEN TRAINING AT https://houstontx.gov/fire/HFMO/highrisecert.html  Any Building Manager in need of High-Rise or Mid-Rise Atruim Certification Training may send attendees to the following monthly seminars at no cost. Monthly seminars are available for management employees and tenant fire wardens of high-rise buildings who need to be certified. Certificates shall be valid for a period of five years from the date of training. There is no charge for attending these seminars. The only cost incurred may be parking fees, if applicable. Many buildings will have different fire safety features. The building management from each building represented is required to inform its employees and Fire Wardens of their specific fire safety features to complete the certification. Please note this training is not valid for Mid Rise Evacuation Training. For information on mid-rise training please visit the HFD Mid Rise Fire Certification Webpage. Additional training availability information: The Houston Fire Department has set up and implemented a list of all high- rise buildings for Fire Safety Plan approvals. This list was set up to ensure that priority is given to buildings that have the greatest need while also providing each building an equal opportunity. The list of buildings is separated into two groups based on whether the building is an occupancy where people sleep, such as hotel, apartments, and condominiums or those buildings where people do not sleep, such as office buildings. Buildings are then sub- grouped by no sprinkler system, partial sprinkler system, or complete sprinkler systems before sorting by building height. The highest priority building is the residential building that is non-sprinklered, and the tallest in height. Our goal is to provide the needed services to approve each building within a two-year cycle. Buildings desiring to expedite the process also have three additional options. The monthly open high-rise certification seminar is for buildings that have requested to send a limited number of fire wardens and building management employees to a class that is open to all high-rise buildings. The class information is not specific to any particular building and requires building management to supplement the training with their building specifics. An inspector/instructor in the Life Safety Bureau, Public Education Section - High-rise Fire Safety Plan Approvals, may be obtained to provide training outside his regular work hours on an overtime basis. This may be done by contacting Diana Cardenas by e-mail at: diana.cardenas@houstontx.gov. This should be done prior to payment of a required permit fee so that an instructor can be assigned to made contact with the requesting party, to assist the requesting party with information on the application for over-time training and payment of the permit fees, and to schedule a mutually convenient training date. A City of Houston permit fee is required to schedule an inspector/instructor. The permit fee is $326.89 plus an admin fee of $29.18 (as of January 2019). Having a City of Houston Fire Marshal approved consultant perform the training. The process to receive an approved Fire Safety Plan consist of the three following essential training elements conducted by persons, institutions or companies approved by the Fire Marshal according to regulations established by the Fire Marshal: a consultation with building management, an approved certification training for Fire Wardens and building employees, and a fire drill supervised by persons, institutions or companies approved by the Fire Marshal.

For information on mid rise training please visitthe HFD Mid Rise Fire Certication Webpage.Additional training availability information:The Houston Fire Department has set up and implemented a list of all high-risebuildings for Fire Safety Plan approvals. This list was set up to ensure thatpriority is given to buildings that have the greatest need while also providingeach building an equal opportunity. The list of buildings is separated into twogroups based on whether the building is an occupancy where people sleep, suchas hotel, apartments, and condominiums or those buildings where people do notsleep, such as office buildings. Buildings are then sub-grouped by no sprinklersystem, partial sprinkler system, or complete sprinkler systems before sortingby building height. The highest priority building is the residential buildingthat is non-sprinklered, and the tallest in height. Our goal is to provide theneeded services to approve each building within a two-year cycle. Buildingsdesiring to expedite the process also have three additional options. 1. The monthly openhigh-rise certification seminar is for buildings that have requested to send alimited number of fire wardens and building management employees to a classthat is open to all high-rise buildings. The class information is not specificto any particular building and requires building management to supplement thetraining with their building specifics.2.

Please note this training is not valid for Mid Rise Evacuation Training. For information on mid-rise training please visit the HFD Mid Rise Fire Certification Webpage. Additional training availability information: The Houston Fire Department has set up and implemented a list of all high- rise buildings for Fire Safety Plan approvals. This list was set up to ensure that priority is given to buildings that have the greatest need while also providing each building an equal opportunity. The list of buildings is separated into two groups based on whether the building is an occupancy where people sleep, such as hotel, apartments, and condominiums or those buildings where people do not sleep, such as office buildings. Buildings are then sub- grouped by no sprinkler system, partial sprinkler system, or complete sprinkler systems before sorting by building height. The highest priority building is the residential building that is non-sprinklered, and the tallest in height. Our goal is to provide the needed services to approve each building within a two-year cycle. Buildings desiring to expedite the process also have three additional options. The monthly open high-rise certification seminar is for buildings that have requested to send a limited number of fire wardens and building management employees to a class that is open to all high-rise buildings. The class information is not specific to any particular building and requires building management to supplement the training with their building specifics.

Please note this training is not valid forMid Rise Evacuation Training. For information on mid rise training please visitthe HFD Mid Rise Fire Certication Webpage.Additional training availability information:The Houston Fire Department has set up and implemented a list of all high-risebuildings for Fire Safety Plan approvals. This list was set up to ensure thatpriority is given to buildings that have the greatest need while also providingeach building an equal opportunity. The list of buildings is separated into twogroups based on whether the building is an occupancy where people sleep, suchas hotel, apartments, and condominiums or those buildings where people do notsleep, such as office buildings. Buildings are then sub-grouped by no sprinklersystem, partial sprinkler system, or complete sprinkler systems before sortingby building height. The highest priority building is the residential buildingthat is non-sprinklered, and the tallest in height. Our goal is to provide theneeded services to approve each building within a two-year cycle. Buildingsdesiring to expedite the process also have three additional options. 1. The monthly openhigh-rise certification seminar is for buildings that have requested to send alimited number of fire wardens and building management employees to a classthat is open to all high-rise buildings. The class information is not specificto any particular building and requires building management to supplement thetraining with their building specifics.2.

This may be done by contacting Diana Cardenas bye-mail at:diana.cardenas@houstontx.gov. This should be done prior to payment of arequired permit fee so that an instructor can be assigned to made contact withthe requesting party, to assist the requesting party with information on theapplication for over-time training and payment of the permit fees, and toschedule a mutually convenient training date.A City of Houston permit fee is required to schedule an inspector/instructor.The permit fee is $326.89 plus an admin fee of $29.18 (as of January 2019).3.
