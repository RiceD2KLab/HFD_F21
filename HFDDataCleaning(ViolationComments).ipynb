Contact the city of Houston Occupancy team to verify that the doors have been permitted and approved. Go through building and ensure all electronic locks have approval stickers. If doors are found that have not been permitted, have them permitted through the City of Houston Occupancy team. 1.  Electromechanical Locks Question: Are electric strikes, electric mortise and other electromechanical locks required to be permitted? Answer: No, electric mortise sets which do not obstruct the path of egress travel in any way are not required to be permitted in most cases by the City unless placed in elevator lobbies or on exit stair doors of high-rise buildings.  Electric strikes which do not obstruct the path of egress travel in any way are not required to be permitted in most cases by the City unless placed in elevator lobbies.  Electric strikes have been ruled illegal for use in exit stairs of high-rise buildings under the International Building Code. Note: All plans submitted for an Electric Lock Permit shall show all existing and proposed electric locks on doors in the path of egress travel, including the locks that may not require permitting, so that the City can verify that no combination of locked doors will block egress.  Locks within privately leased or inaccessible spaces that are not part of the contract and are not part of the commonly shared egress system are not required to be shown on the plans. 403.12 Stairway door operation. Stairway doors other than the exit discharge doors shall be permitted to be locked from stairway side. Stairway doors that are locked from the stairway side shall be capable of being unlocked simultaneously without unlatching upon a signal from the fire command center.
